# virusTotal-ui-python
Study Python & Cyber Security by implementing Virus Total functions in a tkinter UI!

This project demonstrates how to build a VirusTotal client which is using the VirusTotal REST API, together with a tkinter UI.
Good for the understanding of:
- REST API's
- Basic security analysis concepts
- UI programming with python & tkinter
- Basic understanding of python classes
- GIT branches, and the proper way to build your features using them

The code is heavily documented and explains a lot of sotware engineering concepts such as re-use, maintainability and OOP. 



# How To

1) GIT clone the repo
2) CD into the virusTotal-ui-python folder
